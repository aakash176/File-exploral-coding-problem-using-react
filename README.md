# File-exploral-coding-problem-using-react
A machine coding problem which is asked in most of the react interviews. Interviewer may ask to create a file/folder exploral on UI on the basis of data given. For an example, you may have used VS Code or any other IDE where on the left you may see all the files and folders tree and in there you can add new files or folders as a child of any specific parent folder. So, this small coding problem is something like that. Just clone the repo and get inside file-explorer folder and npm i. You are good to go.
If you have something to add, do contribute. 
Thank you.
